# Understanding Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to gain access to confidential information. Attackers use various tactics to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive data.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. Pretexting

Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information from the target. The attacker pretends to need the information to confirm the target's identity.

### 2. Baiting

Baiting involves offering something enticing to the victim in exchange for sensitive information. This could be in the form of free software, music, or even physical media like a USB drive.

### 3. Phishing

Phishing attacks are the most common form of social engineering. Attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, asking the victim to provide personal information.

### 4. Tailgating

Tailgating, or piggybacking, involves an attacker following an authorized person into a restricted area. This is often done without the victim's knowledge or consent.

## Defending Against Social Engineering

- **Education and Training**: Educate employees about social engineering tactics and how to recognize them.
- **Policies and Procedures**: Implement strong security policies and procedures to verify identities and requests.
- **Technology Solutions**: Use technology solutions such as email filters and multi-factor authentication to add layers of security.
