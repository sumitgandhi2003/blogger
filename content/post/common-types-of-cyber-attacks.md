# Common Types of Cyber Attacks

Cyber attacks come in many forms, each with its own methods and objectives. Understanding these attacks is crucial for developing effective defense strategies.

## 1. Phishing

Phishing involves tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information by pretending to be a legitimate entity. Attackers often use emails or fake websites to carry out phishing attacks.

## 2. Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, includes viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware. It is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

## 3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

DoS attacks aim to overwhelm a system or network, making it unavailable to users. Attackers flood the target with excessive traffic or requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.

## 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

In MitM attacks, the attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can lead to data theft or manipulation.

## 5. SQL Injection

SQL injection involves inserting malicious SQL code into a web application's input fields to manipulate the database. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
